				Hello, World! My  name is Emily Le. I am currently a 4th year computer science student at Cal Poly Pomona. One of my main passions is learning. Quite simply, I never want to stop. Over this past year I have picked up some amazing internship opportunities as well as competing in a few local programming competitions. Now, I wish to expand upon that.
				I am currently looking for an Internship that will further improve my programming, creative, and problem solving skills. I am curious, hardworking, and enthusiastic. When I am not programming, you can find me either: writing or performing original music pieces, reading up  on blogs and news feeds about the latest in technology, or cycling and enjoying the beautiful  outdoors.
