				Hello, World! My  name is Emily Le. I am currently a 4th year computer science student at Cal Poly Pomona. One of my main passions is learning. Quite simply, I never want to stop. Over this past year I have picked up some amazing internship opportunities as well as competing in a few local programming competitions. Now, I wish to expand upon that.
				I am currently looking for an internship that will further improve my programming, creative, and problem solving skills. I am curious, hardworking, and enthusiastic. When I am not programming, you can find me writing or performing original music pieces, reading up  on blogs and news feeds about the latest in technology, or cycling and enjoying the beautiful  outdoors.

							This past summer, I spent my time at Esri as a Quality Assurance  intern. I was given multiple tasks including: running/reporting the results of automated tests and reimaging/managing the inventory of my team's machines. One of the bigger projects that I worked on was assessing the viability of using a new in-house test runner. This project gave me valuable project management skills as I partook in creating and delegating task milestones, setting up meetings to further discuss the possibilities of using this application, and rigorously testing this application across a series of operating systems and machines.

						As a software engineering intern at JPL, I was able to work on the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) application. This application is a robust polar climate application which creates models of polar ice caps in Antartica and Greenland. Essentially, these models help reflect the evolution of the ice sheets and its relationship with the environment.  My colleague and I were specifically assigned to develop an automated GUI for ISSM. To develop this, we used a combination of an open sourced application and MATLAB. During my internship, I became familiar with the Linux platform along with using the Bash shell. You can check out the ISSM web page <a class="project_link" href="https://issm.jpl.nasa.gov">here</a>.

						Together, a friend and I entered Cal Poly Pomona's first official hackathon! We created a website to create awareness to those that matter most: the young, fresh, and educated. It's kids like us who can make a positive difference in the world. Ultimately, we tried to do just that. Our site would  contain clear and straightforward information about any catastrophes in the world that may need attention. Additionally, the site would provide tangible ways in which the youth could help our world become better place! You can see our submission <a class="project_link" href="http://challengepost.com/software/love-unity-through-clarity">here</a>.

						Last year, my team of three and I were able achieve first place through Cal Poly Pomona's pre-trials and were able to participate in the SoCal ACM programming competition. It was definitely an experience as it heavily tests our problem solving skills. This year, my team and I will be returning to compete again! Wish us luck!
